## Overview

Melon is a fully self-hostable, open source multipurpose Discord bot engineered to replace the need for several bots in a single server. It supports both **prefix commands** (default: `,`) and **slash commands** through a unified hybrid command system. Persistent data is stored in a **PostgreSQL** database via Sequelize ORM, and every feature is configurable on a per-server basis through setup commands.

## Setup

**Requirements:** Node.js >= 18, PostgreSQL database

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Zerohost356/melon.git
cd melon

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure the bot
# Edit src/config.js with your token, client ID, database URL, and API keys

# 4. Start the bot
npm start
```

---

## Emoji Synchronisation

Melon uses **application emojis** — emojis uploaded directly to the bot's Discord application — so they are available globally across every server without requiring a dedicated emoji server.

On first start, if a `tempassets/` folder is present in the project root containing emoji images (`.webp` for static, `.gif` for animated), Melon automatically:

1. Uploads every image to the bot's application emojis via the Discord API
2. Updates `src/emojis.json` with the new emoji IDs
3. Deletes the `tempassets/` folder
4. Restarts once to load the updated IDs

On all subsequent starts the folder is absent, so the sync is skipped and the bot boots normally. No manual setup is required — the entire process is handled at startup.

> **Note:** `tempassets/` is excluded from the repository via `.gitignore`. To re-run the sync (e.g. after adding new emojis), recreate the folder with the new images and restart the bot.

## Configuration

All configuration lives in `src/config.js`.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token from the Developer Portal |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Bot application/client ID |
| `OWNER_ID` | Your Discord user ID for owner-only commands |
| `PREFIX` | Default text command prefix (default: `,`) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `GROQ.API_KEY` | Groq API key for AI chat |
| `SERPAPI.API_KEY` | SerpAPI key for web search in AI responses |
| `STATUS.status` | Bot presence: `online`, `idle`, `dnd`, `invisible` |
| `STATUS.activity` | Bot activity display text |
| `SUPPORT_SERVER` | Your support server invite link |

The database schema is automatically synced on startup — no manual migrations required.
